## Getting Started

Use this README to get started with our sample pipeline repository for Python. This guide outlines the basics of getting started with the Harness CI and provides a full code sample for you to try out. This sample doesnâ€™t include configuration options, for in depth steps and configuring the pipeline for example using triggers or using our templates see the Pipeline Configuration Docs.

Here we have built a simple two-stage CI Pipeline in Harness. Setting up and running the Pipeline will take about 30 minutes. The Pipeline will build and run a unit test on a sample nodejs repository, upload the artifact to Docker Hub and then run integration tests. You can use publicly-available code, images, and your Github and Docker Hub accounts.

## Workflow
- Build the code and run unit tests.
- Package the app as a Docker image and upload it to Docker Hub.
- Pull the uploaded image to the build farm as a Background Task. Check out more about background tasks here
- Run an integration test against the sample app.
